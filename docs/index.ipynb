    "This repository contains the (developing) open-source code for simulating bulk spin transport---diffusion and separation---in solid media. Multi-spin-species and magnetic resonance simulations are in development.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [FEniCS](https://fenicsproject.org/) project. FEniCS is used to numerically solve the spin transport governing partial differential equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "End users of this project write Python code to interface with FEniCS.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "One must first have a working installation of FEniCS.\n",
    "This README assumes the use of [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) for installation, which is documented [here](http://fenics.readthedocs.io/projects/containers/en/latest/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Then [clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) this repository to the host machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "The FEniCS docs have a section on [workflow](http://fenics.readthedocs.io/projects/containers/en/latest/work_flows.html).\n",
    "There are many ways to instantiate these good practices, but if you're using a \\*nix system, the following may be the easiest.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the cloned `spin-transport` repository as your working directory, create a link in your path to **spin-transport**'s `fenics` executable bash script."

    "Now a FEniCS Python script `foo.py` can be started with the command `fenics foo.py` **from the host** instead of manually starting it from a Docker container.\n",
