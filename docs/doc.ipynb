    "This repository contains the (developing) open-source code for simulating bulk spin transport&mdash;diffusion and separation&mdash;in solid media. Multi-spin-species and magnetic resonance simulations are in development.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [FEniCS](https://fenicsproject.org/) project. FEniCS is used to numerically solve the spin transport governing partial differential equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "End users of this project write Python code to interface with FEniCS.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "One must first have a working installation of FEniCS.\n",
    "This README assumes the use of [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) for installation, which is documented [here](http://fenics.readthedocs.io/projects/containers/en/latest/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Then [clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) this repository to the host machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The FEniCS docs have a section on [workflow](http://fenics.readthedocs.io/projects/containers/en/latest/work_flows.html).\n",
    "There are many ways to instantiate these good practices, but if you're using a *nix system, the following may be the easiest.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the cloned `spin-transport` repository as your working directory, create a link in your path to **spin-transport**'s `fenics` executable bash script.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "ln fenics /usr/local/bin\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now a FEniCS Python script `foo.py` can be started with the command `fenics foo.py` **from the host** instead of manually starting it from a Docker container.\n",
    "This has several advantages, including that there is no need to move scripts into the container and that the complicated syntax need not be remembered.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To verify that everything is installed correctly, run the Poisson equation demo `ft01_poisson.py` ([source](https://fenicsproject.org/pub/tutorial/html/._ftut1004.html)) in your container.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you installed the `fenics` bash script per the instructions above, you can use the following command (working directory: `spin-transport`).\n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "$ fenics ft01_poisson.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If everything is working fine, the output should look something like the following.\n",
